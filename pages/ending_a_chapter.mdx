# Ending a Chapter
The chapter ends when everyone runs out of action cards or when everyone with cards passes the initiative.

When the chapter ends, resolve the following steps.

<Steps>
### Score Ambitions
Score each ambition that has any number of ambition markers in its ambition box on the Map.

- **Tycoon**. Have the most total Fuel and Material icons from resources and Guild Cards.
- **Tyrant**. Have the most Captives on your player board (gained from **taxing** and **securing**).
- **Warlord**. Have the most Trophies on your player board (gained in **battle**).
- **Keeper**. Have the most Relic icons from resources and Guild Cards.
- **Empath**. Have the most Psionic icons from resources and Guild Cards.

The player who gets **first place** for the ambition gains the higher Power shown on all its ambition markers.

The player who gets **second place** for it gains the lower Power shown on all its ambition markers.

Show the Power you gained by advancing your Power marker on the Power track on the bottom edge of the map.

**Ties:** On a tie for first AnimationPlaybackEvent, all tied players get second place.
On a tie for second place, the tied players do not place and gain no Power.

**Qualifying:** You cannot gain Power from an ambition if you have none of the thing it is counting.

**Bonus City Power:** Each time you get first place in an ambition (not tied), gain 2 extra Power if the "+2 to won ambitions" city slot on your player board is uncovered, or gain 5 extra if both the "+2 to won ambitions" and "+3 to won ambitions" city slots on your player board are uncovered.

#### Two-Player Scoring
During setup with 2 players, 6 resources matching the planets with out-of-play markers are placed on the ambition boxes.

For scoring, count these resources as if a third player had them. Weapons on the Warlord box count as Trophies. Otherwise, these resources are out of play.
