# Standard Actions
## Tax (administration)
Choose a Loyal city or choose a Rival city you control.
Gain 1 resource of the city’s planet type from the supply.
If you tax a Rival city, also capture 1 agent of that Rival from
their supply.

_Tax Limit:_ You cannot tax a city more than once per turn.

_Captives:_ Place captured agents in the Captives box on your
player board. They add to your [Tyrant ambition](contribute).

## Build (construction)
You may build a building or a ship:
- Building: Place 1 starport or city in an empty building slot in a system with a Loyal piece. When building a city, use the leftmost city on your player board.
- Ship: Place 1 ship at a Loyal starport. Each starport can only build one ship per turn.

_Blockade:_ When you build anything in a system controlled
by a Rival, place the piece damaged.

## Move (Mobilization & Aggression)
Move any number of Loyal ships from one system to an
adjacent system.

_Starport Catapult:_ If you move from a system with a Loyal
starport, you may keep moving the ships as much as you
want, dropping them off as you want, until they move into
any planet or into a gate controlled by a Rival.

_Out-of-Play Clusters:_ Pairs of paths that are covered with a
path marker become a single path that connects neighboring
gates. Otherwise, you cannot move into out-of-play clusters.

## Repair (Construction & Administration)
Stand up 1 damaged Loyal ship, or flip over 1 damaged
Loyal building. (This can be anywhere on the map!)

## Influence (Mobilization & Administration)
Place 1 agent on any card in the Court. (The Court is the card
row along the map edge.)

## Secure (Aggression)
Take 1 card from the Court if you have more Loyal agents on it
than each Rival.

Return all Loyal agents on it to your supply, and capture all Rival agents from the secured card.
Resolve the card’s When Secured action if any, and then
draw a card from the Court deck and place it in the Court.

_Captives:_ Put agents you capture in the Captives box on your
player board. They add to your Tyrant ambition (page 14).
