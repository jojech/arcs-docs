# Standard Actions
## Tax (administration)
Choose a Loyal city or choose a Rival city you control.
Gain 1 resource of the city’s planet type from the supply.
If you tax a Rival city, also capture 1 agent of that Rival from
their supply.

_Tax Limit:_ You cannot tax a city more than once per turn.

_Captives:_ Place captured agents in the Captives box on your
player board. They add to your [Tyrant ambition](contribute).

## Build (construction)
You may build a building or a ship:
- Building: Place 1 starport or city in an empty building slot in a system with a Loyal piece. When building a city, use the leftmost city on your player board.
- Ship: Place 1 ship at a Loyal starport. Each starport can only build one ship per turn.

_Blockade:_ When you build anything in a system controlled
by a Rival, place the piece damaged.

## Move (Mobilization & Aggression)
Move any number of Loyal ships from one system to an
adjacent system.

_Starport Catapult:_ If you move from a system with a Loyal
starport, you may keep moving the ships as much as you
want, dropping them off as you want, until they move into
any planet or into a gate controlled by a Rival.

_Out-of-Play Clusters:_ Pairs of paths that are covered with a
path marker become a single path that connects neighboring
gates. Otherwise, you cannot move into out-of-play clusters.

## Repair (Construction & Administration)
Stand up 1 damaged Loyal ship, or flip over 1 damaged
Loyal building. (This can be anywhere on the map!)

## Influence (Mobilization & Administration)
Place 1 agent on any card in the Court. (The Court is the card
row along the map edge.)

## Secure (Aggression)
Take 1 card from the Court if you have more Loyal agents on it
than each Rival.

Return all Loyal agents on it to your supply, and capture all Rival agents from the secured card.
Resolve the card’s When Secured action if any, and then
draw a card from the Court deck and place it in the Court.

_Captives:_ Put agents you capture in the Captives box on your
player board. They add to your [Tyrant ambition](contribute).

## Battle (Aggression)
1. **Choose Battle System**: Choose 1 system that has any Loyal ships.
This is the battle system. These are your **attacking ships.**
2. **Choose Defender**: Choose 1 Rival whose pieces are in the battle system.
These are their **defending pieces.**
3. **Collect Dice**: For each attacking ship, you may collect 1 assault, skirmish, or raid die.
    - **Assault dice** damage the defender quickly at some cost to you.
    - **Skirmish dice** damage the defender slowly but keep you safe.
    - **Raid dice** steal stuff from the defender and might damage them but are risky.
**Raid Dice Limit:** You can only collect raid dice if there defending buildings or if the defender has no Loyal buildings in any systems on the map.
4. **Roll and Resolve Dice**: Roll the collected dice.
You must resolve all rolled faces in this order:
    1. Hit any of your **attacking ships** once per <SelfHitIcon />.
    2. If you rolled any number of <InterceptIcon />, the defender **intercepts** you--hit any of your **attacking ships** once per fresh defending ship.
    3. Hit any of their **defending ships** once per BLAST.
    Once no defending ships remain, hit any of their defending buildings instead.
    4. Hit any of their **defending buildings** once per BUILDING HIT.
    5. Raid their **resources and cards** by spending <KeyIcon />, [if you have any attacking ships left](contribute).

If you hit a fresh piece, it becomes **damaged**--tip it over if it's a ship or flip it over if it's a building.

If you hit a damaged piece, it is **destroyed**--remove it.
The attacker takes destroyed defending pieces as Trophies.
The defender takes destroyed attacking pieces as Trophies.

**Trophies:** Place pieces taken as Trophies in the Trophies box on the respective player board. These add to the [Warlord ambition](contribute).

### Destroying Cities
If you destroy a city--even outside battle!--do the following:
1. **Provoke Outrage**. Discard all resources and Guild cards you have of that city's planet type, placing the cards in a face-up Court discard pile near the Court deck. Place an agent to cover the Outrage icon of that city's planet type on your player board--that resource is now **Outraged**.
2. **Ransack the Court**. Secure any card that has **any number** of the defender's agents. Take all Rival agents on the card as **Trophies**, not captives.

**Outrage**: You cannot spend Outraged resources for their normal [Prelude action](contribute).

### Raiding
If any attacking ships remain after taking hits, you may spend <InterceptIcon /> you rolled to steal resources and Guild cards from the defender, one at a time, by spending the number of <KeyIcon /> in its **raid cost**, shown above the resource slot on the player board or in the top-left corner of the [Guild card](contribute).
