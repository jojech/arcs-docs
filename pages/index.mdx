In Arcs, you lead a spacefaring society through an epic saga, as you try to survive in the harsh and
dangerous Reach. A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough **Power**â€”essentially points. In
games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players, 30 Power. With
2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins.
You gain Power by completing **ambitions**, which are objectives that you declare during play.
These are scored at the end of the **chapter**, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game
lasts a varying number of chapters, usually three to five.
Your first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a couple times, a
game should take about 30 minutes per player.
