# Core Concepts
## The Arc of Play
In a game of Arcs, you play through a number of chapters, usually three to five. 
Each chapter is made up of several rounds.
Broadly, in a round, each player will take one turn by playing an action card to do various actions, starting with the player who has initiative.
After everyone takes a turn, players check who gets initiative for the next round. 
You’ll learn more in [Playing a Round](contribute)!
Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards in their hand.
At this point, the chapter ends, players gain Power from ambitions they fulfilled, and everyone draws a new hand of cards.
You’ll learn more in [Ending a Chapter](contribute)!

## Power & Ambitions
The main way to gain Power is by fulfilling
**ambitions**.
The player with the initiative marker may choose to declare the ambition shown on the action card they play on their turn,
marking the matching ambition box on the right map edge.

At the end of the chapter, players gain Power from declared ambitions that they fulfilled best, even if another player declared them.

## The Map
The map is composed of 6 clusters.
Each cluster has 
- 4 systems,
- 3 planets, and
- 1 gate.

(The gate lists the cluster's number, which is used in expansions.)

A gate is **adjacent** to all 3 planets in its cluster and to the 2 gates connected to it by a **path**.
Planets are adjacent to other planets that share a border.
Adjacency is important when you [move](contribute).

In setup, 1 or 2 clusters are covered with **out-of-play markers** and a **path marker**.
All systems in the cluster are out of play in every way, and the path marker joins the neighboring paths, allowing for movement between the neighboring gates in a single move.
Each planet has a planet type, along with 1 or 2 building slots where you can build cities and starports.
(Each planet also has an ID icon, which is used in expansions.)

## Resources & Cities
There are 5 types of resources matching the 5 planet types.
Usually, you gain them by [taxing cities](contribute) and [raiding Rivals in battle](contribute).

Resources can be spent for various [actions](contribute), and some of them add to the Tycoon, Keeper, and Empath [ambitions](page 20).

You hold resource tokens in the resource slots on your player
board. As you build cities, you open resource slots and
uncover Power bonuses for winning ambitions.

## Agents & The Court
Your agents are the bureaucrats and diplomats that administer
your cities and influence powerful interests in the Reach.
Through play, you can place agents on cards in the [Court](page13), a
row of cards along the edge of the map.

If you have the most agents on a card in the Court, you can
[take it](SecurePage13).

## Damage, Control, & Blockade
Pieces start off fresh—ships are fresh when standing upright, and buildings are fresh on their fully colored side. 
By battling, fresh pieces can become damaged, shown by
flipping or tipping it over. If a damaged piece is damaged
again, it is destroyed, removing it from the map.
You control a system and its contents if you have more fresh
ships there than each Rival (other player). On a tie, no one
controls the system.

Controlling a system [blockades](contribute) all Rivals there—you may tax
their cities and capture their pieces, restrict how their ships
move, and damage pieces they build.

## Trophies & Captives
If you destroy a Rival's pieces in [battle](contribute), put them in
the Trophies box on your player board. Trophies add to the
Warlord ambition.

If you capture a Rival's agents, put them in the Captives box
on your player board. Captives add to the Tyrant ambition.
Actions such as [Tax](contribute) and [Secure](contribute) let you
capture Rival agents.
