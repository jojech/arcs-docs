# Playing a Chapter
A game of Arcs lasts up to 5 chapters. In each chapter, you play some number of *rounds*.
In a round, each player takes
one *turn*, starting with the player with the initiative marker.

Broadly, on your turn, you must play 1 *action card*, which lets
you take one or more actions.

At the end of the round, the initiative marker might go to a
new player based on which cards were played.

Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards.
At this point, [the chapter ends](contribute).

<Steps>
### Player with Initiative Takes Turn
As the player with initiative, you must play one action card face
up as the lead card. You may take one [action](contribute)
for each action pip on the lead card based on its suit:
- Administration pips can tax, repair, or influence.
- Aggression pips can battle, move, or secure.
- Construction pips can build or repair.
- Mobilization pips can move or influence.

Place the card in the "Lead" card slot on the left map edge, so
that everyone can reference it as you play through the round.

#### Passing Initiative
If you have the initiative, but you have no cards in your hand
or just choose to skip your turn, you must pass the initiative.
When you pass the initiative, give the initiative marker to
the next clockwise player who has any cards in their hand,
then immediately end the round. The player who now has
initiative will play the lead card of the new round.

If everyone with cards in their hand passes consecutively,
discard all action cards and [end the chapter](contribute).

#### Declaring an Ambition
If you have the initiative, you may declare the ambition
shown on your lead card before taking any actions:
- The “1” cards have no ambition. (Four players only.)
- The “2” through 6” cards let you declare the matching ambition.
- The “7” cards let you declare any ambition. (Four players only.)

Take the highest-number ambition marker from the Available
Markers section on the right map edge, and place it in the
ambition box of the declared ambition.

Place the zero marker onto the lead card to cover the card
number in its top-left corner—its card number is now 0.
You cannot declare an ambition if all 3 ambitions markers are
already placed.

### Other Players Take Turns
After the player with initiative takes their turn, each other
player in clockwise order takes a turn. Players with no cards in
their hand skip their turn.

On your turn, you must play an action card in one of three ways:
- Surpass: Play an action card face up of the lead card’s suit. Its card number must be higher than the lead card. You may take actions up to the number of action pips on your card.
- Copy: Play any action card face down. You may take only one action of the lead card.
- Pivot: Play an action card face up that is not of the lead card’s suit. It can have any card number. You may take only one action on your card.

Place the card in the “Surpass, Copy, or Pivot“ card slot on the
left map edge, so everyone can reference it through the round.

### Check Initiative
After everyone has taken a turn, check whether the initiative
marker goes to a new player.

If no one seized the initiative this round, give the initiative to
the player who Surpassed with the highest card number. If
no one Surpassed, the initiative stays with its holder.
If someone seized the initiative this round, that player keeps
the initiative.

### Discard Cards & Check for New Round
Discard all played cards, and any card used to seize the
initiative, into the shared action discard pile face down.
If any players have any action cards left in their hand, start the
next round. Otherwise, [end the chapter](contribute).
