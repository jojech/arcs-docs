# Guild Cards
You can gain Guild cards by influencing them in the Court and then [securing them](standard_actions#secure-aggression).

Guild cards have 3 parts: their **suit, rules,** and **raid cost.**

**Suit**: This suit icon matches 1 of the 5 resources. It adds to the ambitions just like resources--Material and Fuel cards add to the Tycoon ambition, Relic cards add to the Keeper ambition, and Psionic cards add to the Empath ambition. Weapon cards do not add to any ambitions.

**Rules**: Guild cards give new actions and [modifiers](contribute).

**Raid Cost**: This shows how many <KeyIcon /> an attacker must spend in battle in order to steal the card.
