# Resources
In your turn's [Prelude](contribute), you may spend any number and mix of your resource tokens to optionally use their actions:

IMAGE HERE SHOWING RESOURCE tokens

*Resources are held in resource slots.*
When you take or are given a resource,
place it in an empty resource slot of yours.
To do this, you may rearrange any resources in your resource slots,
but you must discard resources you cannot hold.

If a city returns to your player board and covers a resource slot,
rearrange and discard resources as described above.

Each resource slot has a **raid cost**: the number <KeyIcon /> that the attacker in battle must spend to steal the resource.

*Some cards say that they hold resources.*
By default, these resources can be spent and they add to ambitions,
but they can be stolen only as the card describes.
If a card holding resources is stolen, the resources on the card stay on it. If it is buried or discarded, the resources return to the supply.
